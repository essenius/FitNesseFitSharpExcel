!|script                                  |
|reject          |workbook is protected   |
|ensure          |Select Work sheet|Sheet2|
|reject          |worksheet is protected  |

!|script                                         |
|ensure|protect worksheet with password|secret   |
|ensure|worksheet is protected with password     |
|reject|Set value of cell              |$a$1|to|1|

!|script                                           |
|reject|unprotect worksheet with password|         |
|ensure|worksheet is protected                     |

!|script                                       |
|reject|unprotect worksheet with password|wrong|
|ensure|worksheet is protected                 |

Unprotect with the right password, and check if changing cells works

!|script                                           |
|ensure|unprotect worksheet with password|secret   |
|reject|worksheet is protected                     |
|ensure|Set value of cell                |$a$1|to|2|

Protect with an empty password, and check if changing is now blocked

!|script                                         |
|ensure|protect worksheet with password|         |
|ensure|worksheet is protected                   |
|reject|worksheet is protected with password     |
|reject|Set value of cell              |$a$1|to|4|

Try to re-protect with a password and check if that fails

!|script                                    |
|reject|protect worksheet with password|test|
|reject|worksheet is protected with password|

Unprotect with empty password should now succeed.

!|script                                           |
|ensure|unprotect worksheet with password|         |
|reject|worksheet is protected                     |
|ensure|Set value of cell                |$a$1|to|5|

Protect workbook with a password, then unprotect

!|script                                               |
|protect workbook with password  |secret               |
|ensure                          |workbook is protected|
|unprotect workbook with password|secret               |
|reject                          |workbook is protected|
